###Project PHP / MySQL - Loup-Garou Web

## ...But why ?

After a group project in the first semester of 2019, I made a website using the same technologies in my free time (PHP / MySQL, with Materialize to enhance the UI).
This aims to be a web-version to learn about the Loup-Garou game, and perhaps, to host games (PHP isn't the best language for that, so I'll work that out).


## The website

I'll keep here all the links where the website is active
